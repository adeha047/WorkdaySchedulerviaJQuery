# WorkdaySchedulerviaJQuery

I tried the use of JQuery to run through the for loop used to connect the actual hour and past, present and future. 
I used date object to call the exat date and time. 
I then used localstorage to display text placed in each hour. 
I then used the CSS styling to display the past, present and future of the current time. 
I used a Jquery function to call the text and time of variables.
